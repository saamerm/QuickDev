**API CALLLLSSSS!!!**
==================
##**Intro**
This repository is used by me (Saamer Mansoor) to practice and make cross platform Xamarin apps.
I ONLY edit and change the "Part 2" folder solutions, so don't bother with the other folders.
The master branch only gives you weather of Chicago.
Eventually I want to be able to get data from my Particle photon (Spark core) device and display it for users.
If you download and check the Particle photon branch, you will be able to see that I get data from the device in real time.

You just need to setup Thingspeak as shown in the Particle photon website documentation and get that into the app.
Please reach out to me on twitter @saamerm if you have any questions whatsoever!


The stuff below this is from the guy who I forked this from.


Future upgrades-
Using this to only take the latest data from the Thingspeak
